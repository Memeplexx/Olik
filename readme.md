### ***Compact, transparent, typesafe, in-line state-management*** ###
---
## WHAT PROBLEMS DOES THIS LIBRARY TRY TO SOLVE? ##
ðŸ˜§ Current state management solutions are typically characterized by:
* excessive plumbing around setting up,
* unergonomic ceremony around data-flow,
* convoluted immutable state updates inside reducers,
* actions which needless re-describe simple updates,
* actions that inaccurately describe complex updates.

ðŸš€ Oulik is designed to address all these issues by exposing an API which:  
* allows you to select a piece of your state, and then apply an update that piece,
* describes state updates for you (generating actions on your behalf),
* makes setup simple, including auto-integrating with the [Redux Devtools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en).

> **NOTE:** The rest of this guide illustrates how to use Oulik **without a framework.** It may be more appropriate for you to check out the docs for the following framework bindings:

## GETTING STARTED ##

```console
npm install oulik
```
```Typescript
import { make } from 'oulik';

const store = make('my store', {
  user: { firstname: '', lastname: '' },
  hobbies: new Array<string>(),
});       
```
*Auto-registers with the Redux Devtools Extension. Initial state must be serializable. It can be a simple primitive, or something far more nested.*

## WRITING STATE ##
```Typescript
store(s => s.user.firstname).replaceWith('James');
```
*Your state will be efficiently replaced using the action: `{ type: 'user.firstname.replaceWith()', payload: 'James' }`.*

## READING STATE ##

```Typescript
const username = store(s => s.user.firstname).read();
```
