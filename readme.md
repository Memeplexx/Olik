### ***Compact, transparent, typesafe, in-line state-management*** ###
---
## WHAT PROBLEMS DOES THIS LIBRARY TRY TO SOLVE? ##
üëΩ Many current state management solutions are typically plagued by:
* **excessive plumbing** around setting up,
* unergonomic ceremony around **data-flow**,
* **convoluted immutable state updates** inside reducers,
* actions which **needlessly re-describe simple updates**,
* actions that **inaccurately describe complex updates**.

üöÄ Oulik is not only **painless to setup**, it makes **state updates effortless** and **consistent**, by **generating your actions for you** within the [Redux Devtools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)

‚ö†Ô∏è The rest of this guide illustrates how to use Oulik **without a framework.** It may be more appropriate for you to check out:

## GETTING STARTED ##

```console
npm install oulik
```
```Typescript
import { make } from 'oulik';

const store = make('my store', {
  user: { firstname: '', lastname: '' },
  hobbies: new Array<string>(),
});       
```
*Auto-registers with the Redux Devtools Extension. Initial state must be serializable.*

## WRITING STATE ##
```Typescript
store(s => s.user.firstname).replaceWith('James');
```
*Your state will be efficiently replaced using the action: `{ type: 'user.firstname.replaceWith()', payload: 'James' }`.*

## READING STATE ##

```Typescript
const username = store(s => s.user.firstname).read();
```

## BEST PRACTICES ##

Oulik is absurdly simple to use, and most of the time, the API corrals you into making only 1 decision.  
That said, if you don't already have some experience with Redux or NGRX, it's worth checking this small guide.
