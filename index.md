# Oulik state management
{: .fs-9 }
Oulik provides a minimal, but powerful, set of **state update abstractions** making for a crystal-clear state-management experience. ðŸ‘Œ
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

It also supports various **opt-in**, **tree-shakable** features including **memoization**, **caching**, and the ability to **dynamically nest component-level stores** within your application-level store.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

```ts
const get = make({
  user: { name: '', age: 0 },
  hobbies: new Array<{ id: number, txt: string }>(),
  some: { deeply: { nested: { number: 0 } } },
});
```
```ts
get(s => s.user.name).replace('James');
```
```ts
get(s => s.hobbies).upsertWhere(h => h.id === 3).with({ id: 3, txt: 'Baking' });
```
```ts
get(s => s.some.deeply.nested.number).replace(1);
```
